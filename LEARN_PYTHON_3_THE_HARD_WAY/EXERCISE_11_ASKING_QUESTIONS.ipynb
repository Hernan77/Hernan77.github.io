    "Now it is time to pick up the pace. You are doing a lot of printing to get you familiar with typing simple things, but those simple things are failry boring. What we want to do now is get data into your programs. This is a little bit tricky because you have to learn to do two things that may not make sense right away, but trsut me and do it anyway. It will make sense in a few exercises.\n",

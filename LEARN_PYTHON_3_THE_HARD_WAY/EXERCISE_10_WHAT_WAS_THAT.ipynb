    "## WHAT WAS THAT?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Exercise 9 I thre you some new stuff, juat to keep you on your toes. I showed you two ways to make a string that goes across multiple lines. In the first way, we put the characters \\n (backslash n) between the names of the months. These two characters put a *new line character* into the string at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \\ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string. There are various *escape sequences* available for different characters you might want to use. We'll try a few of these sequences so you can see what I mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important *escape sequence* is to escape a single-quote (') or double-quote (\"). Imagine you have string that uses a double-quote and you want to put a double-quote inside the string. If you write \"I \"understand\" Joe.\" then Python will get confused because it will think the double-quotes around \"understand\" actuallly end the string. You need a way to tell Python that the double-quote inside the string *isn't a real* double-quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem you *escape* double-quotes so Python knows to include them in the string. Here's an eample:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I am 6'2\\\" tall.\" # escape double-quote inside string\n",
    "'I am 6\\'2\" tall.' # escape single-quote inside string\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is by triple-quotes, which is just \"\"\" and works like a string, but you also can put as many lines of text as you want until you type \"\"\" again. We'll also play with these. "

    "**I don't get Study Drill 3. What do you mean by \"combine\" escape sequences and formats?** One concept I need you to understand is that each of these exercises can be combined to solve problems. Take what you know about format strings and write some new code that uses format strings and the escape sequences from this exercise.\n",

    "\n",
    "**I get can't open file 'ex1.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory**. You need to be on the same directory as the file you created. Make sure you use the *cd* command to go there first. For example, if you saved your file in lpthw/ex1.py, then you would do *cd lpthw/* before trying to run *python3.6 ex1.py*. If you don't know what any of that means, then go through the appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My file doesn't run; I just get the prompt back with no output.** You most likely took the code in my ex1.py file literally and thought that *print(\"Hello World!\")* meant to type only *\"Hello World!\"* inot the line, without the *print*. Your file has to be exactly like mine."

    "Now you can print things an do math. The next step is to learn about variables in programming, a variable is nothing more than a name for something, similar to how my name, \"Zed\" is a name for \"the human being who wrote this book.\" Porgrammers use these variable names to make their code read more like English and because they have lousy memories. If they didn't use good names for things in their software, they'd get lost when they tried to read their code again.\n",

    "**Are you sure # is called the pound character?** I call it the octothorpe because that is the only name that no one country uses and that works in every country. Every country thinks its name for this one character is both the most important way to do it and the only way it's done. To me this is simply arrogance and, really, y'all should just chill out and focus on more important things like learning to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What does # in print(\"hi # there.\") not get ignored?** THe # in that code is inside a string, so it will be put into the string until the ending \" character is hit. Pound character in strings are just considered characters, not comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do I comment out multiple lines?** Put a # in front of each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**I can't figure out how to type a # character on my country's keyboard. How do I do that?** Some countries use the ALT key and combinations of other keys to print characters foreign to their language. You'll have to look online in a search engine to see hpow to type it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do I have to read code backward?** It's a trick to make your brain not attach meaning to each part of the code, and doing that makes you process each piece exactly. This is a handy error-checking technique. "

    "While you have been writing strings, you still do not know what they do. In this exercise we create a buncvh of variables with complex strings so you can see what they are for. First an explanation of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or \"export\" out of the program you are writing. Python know you want something to be a string when you put either \" (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text. You saw this many time with your use of print when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside \" or ' after the print to print the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings can contain any number of variables that are in your Python script. Remember that a variable is any line of code where you set a nem = (equal) to a value. In the code for this exercise, types_of_people = 10 creates a variable named types_of_people and sets it = (equal) to 10. You can put that in any string with {types_of_people}. You also see that I have to use a special type of string to \"format\"; it's is called an \"f-string\" and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "f\"some stuff here {avariable}\"\n",
    "f\"some other stuff {anothervar}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has another kind of formatting suing the .format() syntax, which you see on line 17. You'll see me use that sometimes when I want to apply a format to an already-created string, such as in a loop. We'll cover that more later.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now type in a whole buncvh of strings, variables, and formats, and print them. We will also practice using short, abbreviated variable names. Programmers love saving time at your expense by using annoyingly short and cryptic variable names, so let's get you started reading and writing them early on."

    "\n",
    "Now we'll do even more typing of variables and printing them out. This time we'll use something called *format string*. Every time you put \" (double-quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a *string*. A string is how you make something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files, send strings to web servers, among other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are really handy, so in this exercise you will learn how to make strings that have variables embedded in them. You embed variables inside a string by uysing a special {} sequence and then put the variable you want inside the {} characters. You must also start the string with the letter f for \"format\", as in f\"Hello {somevar}\". This little f before the \" (double-quote) and the {} characters tell Python 3, \"Hey, this string needs to be formated. Put these variables in there.\"\n",

    "As usual, just ype this in even if you don't understand it, and make it exactly the same."

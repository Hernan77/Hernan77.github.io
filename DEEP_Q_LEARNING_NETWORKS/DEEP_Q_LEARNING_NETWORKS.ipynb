    "The main idea of a **Markov Decision Process** is that we have some agent, in our case a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, that takes some **action** in an **environment**. The environment provides the agent two kinds of information as feedback. The first kind is the **state**, which porvides information about the environment. The second kind is the **reward** that we try to maximize.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can define this idea formally from the following set of terms. The trademark of any **Markov Decision Process** is that we assume that the current state of the environment at any given time step is representative of all the time steps that have came before \n",

    "<left><img src=\"IMAGES/Fig_2.png\" width=\"400\"></left><br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **discount factor** is a hyperparameter that we set ourselves. This is how much our agent discounts future reward. When our agent is considering any given action taken in the environment, the agent is going to take the action that maximizes its reward. The further it tries to predict a future reward, the less likely that reward is. The expected reward in the next time step is valued more highly than the expected reward in two or three time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given any set of states, our goal is to create a **policy (pi)** that maps our states to our actions. So, given some states we want to have this overall polciy of what action we should be taking on those states. The policy function is what we are trying to learn with our deep reinformenet learning algorithm. \n",

    "<center><img src=\"IMAGES/Fig_3.png\" width=\"80\"></center><br/><br/>\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMAGES/Fig_5.png\" width=\"250\"></center><br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Q-value function** is one step more complex. The Q-value function considers both the state, and a given action. It tells us what is the maximum expected reward form the situation of being in a particular state and taking a particular action, and then following our policy afterwards. \n",

    "We are going to try to approximate Q<sup>*</sup> by using **Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN)**. DQN is a partciular type of Deep Reinforment Learning Agent. We add the **theta** term to our Q function. Theta represents all the weights in this kind of function that we are using to approximate Q<sup>*</sup>. So we have a Q with a particular state and a particular action. With the set of weights (represented by theta) we can estimate what the maximum expected reward can be. Theta can be any kind of function, for example a linear regression model. However what makes DQN a Deep Reinforment learning method is that theta is a **deep neural network (NN)**. This means that you build some architecture with tensorflow or keras, to have a set of weights and biases. In our case we will use dense layers to approximate the equation above."
